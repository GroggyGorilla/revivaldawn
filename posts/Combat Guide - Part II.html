[size=16][b]REFLEX CHECKS[/b][/size]


[hr]

[size=14][b]REFLEX RATIO (RX%)[/b][/size]
When engaging an opponent in combat, you must first calculate your Reflex Ratio (RX%). This ratio is the attacker’s reflex stat (RX) divided by the defender’s RX. Each engagement between two fighters should have two RX%s; one for each fighter. As far as RX%s are concerned, when you use [i]any technique[/i] (yes, even a defensive one) on an opponent, you are the attacker and your opponent is the defender. 

[size=16][b]ROLLING THE DICE[/b][/size]
Each use of a technique must have a “Reflex Check” die roll affiliated with it. When you use a technique in your post, you [b]must clarify[/b] the technique name and the type of technique (HT/LT/UT etc.) you are using. 

The following images will give you a rough idea of how RX check rolls work. Exact instructions for various scenarios (such as NPC Quest Bosses, Crew Companions, and PvP fights) are given below the images.

[size=16][b]HOW DO QUEST BOSSES AND CREW COMPANIONS FIGHT BACK?[/b][/size]
Your Crew Companions and Quests Bosses will be controlled by you during your posts. However, you must ensure that you remain within their character boundaries and not force them to go out of character for your own convenience/safety.

[b]QUEST BOSSES:[/b] For every post you are involved in combat with a Quest Boss, you must do a separate post for your rolls first. This “Combat Mini-Post (CMP)” is so you can find out the gist of how that particular exchange of techniques between you and the boss will turn out, and thus you can RP out the techniques [i]and[/i] the consequences accordingly in the following post. In the CMP, you will be required to roll for any and all attacks made by you, your Crew Companions, and the Quest Boss you are engaging. 

[b]Quest Boss stats:[/b] A Quest Boss’ stats would be the same as a player’s stats at that level. Except a Quest Boss does not get any stat bonuses like starting bonuses or equipment bonuses. Also, a Quest Boss’ lowest stat can generally not be less than 50% of the Quest Boss’ highest stat. (Unless an exception is made by a Mod/Admin.)

[b]Quest Boss techniques:[/b] 

[u]Tier 1 Quest Bosses[/u] (Level 1-19) must use 2 LTs every round of posts.
Every fifth round of posts, the quest boss must use 1 HT instead.

[u]Tier 2 and above Quest Bosses[/u] must use 1 MT + 2 LTs every round of posts. 
Every third round of posts, the quest boss must use 1 HT instead. 
And every sixth round of posts, the quest boss must use 1 AoE instead (no HT in this round).

Additionally, every quest boss must also use 1 UT against each opponent they are facing.

These techniques can be made up on the spot and are not required to have tracked cooldowns. And despite being called “named techniques”, the bosses’ techniques don’t [i]have[/i] to be named as long as the technique class of the boss is made clear the moment it is used during the RP post.

In the Combat Mini-Post (CMP - see section below), all you must do is list out the attack classes that will be made in the following post and roll RX checks for them. The CMP is considered an OOC post, so you must not include any IC content in this post. 
Then, in your proper RP post that follows, you will not only know whether your own techniques landed, but you will also know if your boss’ retaliating techniques succeeded. Then you can RP out the execution and results of those techniques accordingly in this post.

[size=16][b]COMBAT MINI-POST (CMP) FORMAT[/b][/size]
All CMPs should be formatted and executed as follows:
<img class="img-modal" src="https://i.servimg.com/u/f11/18/75/26/17/minipo11.png" alt="" />
[b]Note:[/b] CMPs do not count towards your quest’s minimum required post count. 

[size=16][b]RP POST FORMAT[/b][/size]
All RP posts must then keep track of the status of each character involved in combat as follows:
<img class="img-modal" src="https://i.servimg.com/u/f11/18/75/26/17/rppost10.png" alt="" />
[b]EDIT:[/b] [color=red]The trackers for RP Posts have been updated. Please add and fill out the following combat trackers template to each RP post once you engage in combat.[/color]

[b]TESTING THE WATERS[/b]
For the first two rounds when the boss combat engagement begins, the player can choose to have the boss “test out the waters” by using fewer techniques than their normal combos. However, if the player starts the engagement by using their own complete combo or a surprise attack, then the boss must use their full combo in response.

[size=14][b]TEAMING UP AGAINST A BOSS[/b][/size]
Multiple players may team up against a single boss. In the first round of combat, at least one player must have the boss use a full combo against them. In each subsequent round, the boss will use their full combo against the player that dealt them the most damage in the previous round. The boss will use a 2 LT combo against every remaining player engaging them, and 1 UT against each Crew Companion (see Player Crew Companions section below) engaging them. Note that Bosses will also use 1 UT against each player engaging them in that player’s post.

[b]TAUNTING NPC BOSSES[/b]
If your WP is at least 50% as much as the boss you are teaming up against, you may taunt the boss into using their full combo against you instead of the player who dealt the most damage in the previous round.

[b]CREW COMPANIONS[/b]
Your Crew Companions can use [u]one MT and one UT[/u] per post. Again, these MTs must be Flats and can be made up on the spot. Your Crew Companions cannot use any more than one UT per post, even if they’re engaging multiple opponents. 

You can have up to two healer Crew Companions, but only one of them can be used in each individual boss fight. This Companion can use a Heal MT instead of a Flat MT every three rounds.

Additionally, you may only have [u]up to two Crew Companions[/u] attacking the same opponent at any given time. 

<span data-qltext="PvP" id="rdql_pvp">[size=16][b]PLAYER VS. PLAYER (PvP)[/b][/size]</span>
When combat initiates between players, each player must try to [b]avoid godmodding[/b] during this engagement. For combat between players, there is no need for CMPs as with NPC Quest Boss engagements. Instead, each RP post must have an additional OOC spoiler tag at the end declaring the order and targets of techniques being used similar to how it would be done in a CMP. And then in that very same RP post, you will also roll for all of the techniques being used in that post by you and your Crew Companions.

Through this method, the player opponent will have the opportunity to react appropriately to your techniques in their following post; and godmodding will have been avoided since you would not know if your techniques landed until [i]after[/i] you have posted.

<span data-qltext="Reflex Ratio Chart" id="rdql_rx-ratio-chart">[size=16][b]REFLEX RATIO - DIE ROLL CHART[/b][/size]</span>
Once you have calculated your RX% and rolled the dice for your techniques, check the table below to see if your attacks succeeded.

[b]Example Scenario:[/b] Say your Reflex is 70 while your opponent’s reflex is 50. This means [i]your[/i] RX% is 70/50 = 140% and [i]your opponent’s[/i] RX% is 50/70 = 71%. (If the RX% has decimal places, it is always rounded down to the nearest natural number.) 
Now, if you were to attack your opponent with an HT and an LT during your turn, you would roll two dice. To find out if you succeeded, you would check the minimum die roll required for successful hits. In this case, for a successful HT, you would need a die roll of [i]at least[/i] 8. Anything 8 and above will grant you a successful hit. For the LT, your minimum die roll required would be 4. 
If your opponent was to use the same classes  of attacks against you, they would require a minimum die roll of 14 for a successful HT, and at least a 10 for a successful LT.

[size=14][b]INTERVENING OR INTERRUPTING TECHNIQUES AND COMBOS[/b][/size]
During combat, even if you roll a successful hit, your opponent will have the chance to “intervene” using a technique if their RX% is at least 81%. For example, if you used 3 LTs in quick succession in your turn, and then in the following turn, your opponent also used 3 LTS of their own, they can apply each one of their LTs’ effects after each one of yours. If the opponent’s RX% is at least 121%, they can apply each technique’s effects [i]before[/i] each of your technique’s effects are applied (one-to-one order must be maintained).

If the opponent’s RX% is less than 81%, their techniques’ effects will not take effect until they’ve accounted for all the effects dealt by your combo. Also, the opponent may only intervene with a technique of the same class or a lower damage-dealing class than the one they are intervening. (An MT may not be interrupted by HT or AoE; an LT may not be interrupted by MT, HT or AoE, etc.)


[size=14][b]MISSED HITS[/b][/size]
If you [b]miss a hit[/b] completely, the missed technique's [b]cooldown is halved[/b]. If the halved number is a decimal number, it must be rounded up. For example, a missed LT with a 2 round cooldown will still have a 2 round cooldown. A missed MT with a 4 round cooldown will instead have a 2 round cooldown.
The cooldown reduction only applies to an AoE if the AoE misses all of its targets (see the next title to understand why this is the case).
The cooldown reduction does not apply to buffing Stat Morphs and Hybrids since those are guaranteed hits.

[size=14][b]AOE REFLEX CHECK ROLLS[/b][/size]
When attacking multiple opponents with a single named technique, you only roll once for that technique. You then compare that same die roll with your RX% for each opponent individually.


[size=14][b]CRITICAL AND GRAZING HITS[/b][/size]
When you roll a die, your die roll will determine if you landed a solid hit, a grazing hit, or a successful hit.
[b]Solid hit:[/b] Solid hits are simply successful hits that deal [b]normal damage[/b].
[b]Grazing hit:[/b] If you roll one value less than what you are required to roll for a successful hit, your attack is considered a "grazing hit". Grazing hits deal [b]0.5x damage[/b], or cut the stat morphs and heal effects in half (round down).
[b]Critical hit:[/b] If your RX% is at least 51% against an opponent and you roll a 20, that attack will be a critical hit. Critical hits deal [b]1.5x damage[/b]. Critical hits do not apply to stat morphs or heals.

[b]Note:[/b] When the calculated damage is a decimal number, it is rounded down to the nearest natural number.

[size=14][b]ESCAPING AND CHASING AN ESCAPING OPPONENT[/b][/size]
Starting from the very first post you engage an opponent, and then once every other round, you may attempt to run away from the opponent you are fighting against by rolling a separate RX check (this RX check is [i]always[/i] rolled [u]last[/u] in Dice Roll No.1 of the Combat Mini-Post). If you succeed, the opponent may then attempt to chase you by rolling an RX check (this RX check is also rolled last).

The die roll required to make an escape is based on your RX%. The required roll value is the same as a die roll value required for a successful MT.

In a post where you attempt an escape, you may not use any combos that use HTs or AoEs.

If you roll a successful escape against a quest NPC, you may then proceed to RP your character as having escaped them fully. However, if you roll a successful escape against a player or an Important NPC, the opponent will then have the chance to give chase in the following post. They can do this by rolling an RX check. If the chase roll's value is higher than the (escape roll value - 3), the opponent will successfully be able to chase you and you will need to attempt escape again.

While an escape or a chase is being attempted, neither the escapee nor the pursuer can use HTs or AoEs.

Once you have successfully escaped an opponent, they cannot engage you in combat mechanically unless you re-engage them with an attack.

If you escape an NPC boss successfully and that boss is not engaged by another opponent, you may reset your cooldowns, techniques, and HP (the boss' HP must be reset also) and attempt to fight the boss a second time. The fight would—mechanically—begin anew.

[size=14][b]RESCUING A PLAYER[/b][/size]
Once every other round, you may attempt to rescue an ally from an opponent they are fighting against by rolling a separate RX check (this RX check is [i]always[/i] rolled [u]last[/u] in Dice Roll No.1 of the Combat Mini-Post).

The die roll required to rescue someone is based on your RX%. The required roll value is the same as a die roll value required for a successful HT.

In a post where you rescue someone, you may not use any combos that use HTs or AoEs.

If you roll a successful rescue, the rescued player may then RP as having escaped them fully. However, if you roll a successful escape against a player or an Important NPC, the opponent will then have the chance to give chase to the escaped player in the following post. They can do this by rolling an RX check. If the chase roll's value is higher than the (rescue roll value - 3), the opponent will successfully be able to chase you and you will need to attempt rescue again.

[size=14][b]TANK A HIT (Sacrifice yourself!)[/b][/size]
You may tank an opponent's successful attacks against a player ally to have them damage you instead. In this scenario, you must create an OOC post immediately after the opponent’s attack die roll post. In this OOC post, you will roll a single die and specify which combo it is meant to tank. 

This die roll’s success will be determined based on your RX%. If you roll a successful LT with this die roll, you will be able to take the damage from all or some of the techniques in this combo (any damage you choose not to tank will be dealt to the original target). The damage dealt by the tanked hits will be determined by the opponent’s DMG% (see <a href="#rdql_atk-vs-def">Damage Multiplier section</a> below) against your DEF.

You may then follow this OOC post with a short RP post that interrupts the normal posting order (this does not count towards the total post count) to RP out your tanked hit. You may not use any techniques in this short RP post. After this post, the normal posting order will resume.

[size=14][b]STEALTH AND SURPRISE ATTACKS[/b][/size]
Utilizing the kenbunshoku haki mechanics (which are explained in detail in the next section), a player has the opportunity to make a stealth or surprise attack against an opponent. To do so, the player must either be attacking the opponent from outside of the opponent’s “kenbunshoku” detection range, or the player must have their own kenbunshoku haki activated to hide their presence. 

This surprise attack must either be an MT+LT+UT combo or an LT+LT+LT+UT combo. The surprise attack will have a higher chance of hitting than normal attacks. Your techniques will be successful with up to two dice roll values lower than what would normally be required for a successful hit. For example, if your LT needs a die roll value of 10 to be successful normally, the surprise LT will instead require a minimum die roll value of 8.

Once this surprise attack lands, the opponent can react to it in the following post (in the same post for Quest Bosses but after the attacks’ effects are applied) and the “stealth” will be considered compromised.

While the presence of a player is hidden, their opponent cannot detect them (unless the player is very obviously visible and hostile or has at least 151% willpower of the hiding player) nor engage them in combat until the hiding player makes their first attack.

<span data-qltext="ATK vs DEF Checks" id="rdql_atk-vs-def">[size=18][b]ATTACK vs DEFENSE CHECKS[/b][/size]</span>

[hr]

[size=14][b]DAMAGE MULTIPLIERS (DMG%)[/b][/size]
As mentioned above, each technique class has a certain base damage. The values are as follows:
UT: 5
LT: 10
MT: 20
HT: 50
AoE: 50 (to each opponent caught within AoE)

When you land a successful hit on your opponent, your attack stat is matched with their defense stat. To determine the actual damage dealt, you must calculate your damage multiplier first.

The [b]Damage Multiplier (DMG%)[/b] is simply the percentage value of the attacker’s attack stat (ATK) divided by the defender’s defense stat (DEF). 
For example, if you had 150 ATK and were attacking an opponent with 200 DEF, your DMG% would be (150/200) = 75%.
This DMG% would then be multiplied to the base damage of each class of technique to find out the true damage. 
So, in this example, you would deal only 75% of the base damage to your opponent with any of the techniques you use. If you were to land a solid HT, it would deal (0.75*50) = 37 damage to your opponent.

[b]Note:[/b] When the damage multiplier percentage is a decimal number, it is rounded down to the nearest natural number.

[size=14][b]DAMAGE DISTRIBUTION[/b][/size]
As you may have noticed earlier, AoEs appear to be the only techniques which can do damage to multiple opponents at the same time. That is not actually the case. AoEs are the only techniques which do [i]full[/i] damage to multiple opponents at once.

When hitting multiple opponents at once with a single LT, MT or HT, the damage dealt to each opponent is calculated separately using the following formula.
[The damage that technique would do to that opponent if he/she were the sole target] divided by [The total number of opponents being targeted by that technique]

UTs do not need to go through this calculation because you may deal damage equal to 1 UT to every opponent you are facing per post.


[hr]

[size=16][b]HITPOINTS (HP)[/b][/size]

[hr]

Each character (grunts and non-essential NPCS not included) has a base HP of 100. This HP is then affected by WP. 50% of a character’s WP is added to the base HP to determine a character’s true HP. Note that this [i]does not[/i] change the character’s WP. 
So, if a character’s WP was 200, their HP would be 100+(0.50*200)= 200.

When a player’s HP runs out, they are “knocked out”. In a “knocked out” state, players can actually continue to move and talk, however, they cannot use any techniques (not even UTs). Nor can they use their passive abilities which, in any way, affect their stats. In this state, they will suffer a 50% reflex debuff. While “knocked out”, players recover 10% of their HP per round of posts. Once they’re back to 50% of their HP, they will be removed from the “knocked out” state.

In a “knocked out” state, players can also choose to either skip their posts or control their Crew Companions (or other NPCs) if they have some. They can also write dream or flashback posts, or even interesting narration posts in their turns. If they choose to roleplay their knock out state by actually becoming unconscious, they will suffer a 100% reflex debuff, but will instead recover 25% of their HP per round of posts. While a player is knocked out, the character who knocked the player out will also recover 10% HP per post regardless of whether they are engaged in combat (but for only as long as the player remains knocked out).

While a player is in a knocked out state, the boss that knocked them out will also recover the same percentage of HP as the player.

Every time a player is knocked out, they must choose one of their lowest-tiered [b]equipment to break[/b]. In this broken state, the equipment will not provide its stat bonuses until it is repaired at the [url=https://www.revivaldawn.com/t15-the-shop-of-dreams#16]Shop of Dreams[/url].

A player can also recover HP simply by “resting”. This means that if they do not use any non-healing techniques (not even UTs), they will recover 5% of their HP during that turn.

A player’s HP can be healed at any time using healing techniques. And a player [i]will not lose HP[/i] while in a knocked out state.

If you apply a willpower debuff to an opponent, their HP will also be affected. If your opponent had 200 willpower (i.e. 150 HP), and you give them a 25% willpower debuff, their willpower will be 150 during that duration and their max HP will be 100+(0.25*150) = 137. If their HP was already reduced to 50% of 150 before the debuff, their HP during the debuff will instead be 50% of 137. And by the time the debuff ends, if their HP is reduced further to 30% of 137, after the debuff, their HP will be 30% of 150 instead.


[hr]
<span data-qltext="Death & Arresting" id="rdql_death-mechanics">[size=18][b]DEATH AND KILLING!<br/>ATTACK vs WILLPOWER CHECKS[/b][/size]</span>

[hr]

When a quest NPC boss runs out of HP, it is up to the player's discretion whether that Quest Boss is knocked out or killed. But, when a player or an important NPC (including Crew Companions) runs out of HP, they are simply “knocked out”. If you then try to kill the player or important NPC, you must go through an attack vs willpower check.

If your own character is "knocked out" in a quest, you must have the Quest Boss attempt to kill you using the system below. If it goes against the boss' personality to kill you, then you must have other factors (bleeding out, grunts, etc.) try to kill you RP-wise, while mechanically, it would appear as if the boss is attempting to kill you.

The following system only applies to player characters and Important NPCs while they’re “knocked out”. 

The percentages that follow represent the attacker's ATK divided by the defender's WP:
<101% = No amount of hits will kill an opponent.
101%-150% = Only two critical HTs can kill an opponent. (These hits are stackable. So, if one critical HT is landed in one knock out, and then another critical HT is landed in a second knock out in the same thread, that character will die.)
151%-200% = Only two critical HTs or MTs can kill an opponent.
201%-300% = Three consecutive solid HTs in a row, or a single critical HT or MT can kill an opponent.
301%-500% = Two consecutive solid HT or MT, or a single critical HT, MT, or LT can kill an opponent. 
>500% = One consecutive solid HT or MT, or any type of single critical hit can kill an opponent.


[hr]

[size=16][b]ARRESTING AND KIDNAPPING PLAYERS[/b][/size]

[hr]

When a character is "knocked out", a player can attempt to arrest or kidnap that character. The character making the arrest [b]must not be engaged in combat[/b] with other players or crew companions. To make an arrest, the arrester must roll an RX check. If they roll a solid HT, the arrest will succeed.

Once the arrested character exits their knock out state, they have 3 posts to attempt an escape. But, during these 3 posts, they will suffer a -50% reflex debuff and a -50% attack debuff. (This debuff [b]does not stack[/b] with sea prism stone debuffs.) They will not be able to use any weapons or techniques which involve them using their devil fruit powers or bondaged limbs (so long as the appropriate items are used RP-wise to justify this restriction). 

During these 3 posts, the arrested character can roll an "escape combat" RX check. (See the escape mechanics mentioned above for required roll values.) If they succeed, they can escape an arrest. If they were arrested by a player character, however, the player character can roll a chasing RX check in the following post. This "struggling" process can be repeated every post for these 3 posts. But, after these 3 posts, the arrested character must [i]mechanically[/i] submit to the instructions of the character making the arrest.

During the struggling process, neither the arrested player nor the player making the arrest will recover HP. And so, the arrested player can instead choose to fight back in the 3 posts of the struggling process. If they manage to knock out their opponent, they will be freed from the arrest. But, if they fail to defeat or escape the opponent within these 3 posts, they will “officially” be arrested (or kidnapped).

Once a player is officially arrested, the arrester or kidnapper must then complete an [b]ARC[/b] quest to “transport the prisoner”.

If the person making the arrest is a bounty hunter or marine, they will transport the prisoner to either Impel Down or an owned or allied turf. However, if the person is being kidnapped, they [i]must be[/i] transported to a self-owned or ally-owned turf of the kidnapper. If a kidnapper doesn’t have a turf to stash the prisoner in, they must haul around the prisoner with them in every quest they do. And in each one of this quests, an ally of the prisoner can intercept and attempt to rescue the prisoner.

During each thread of this arc, an ally of the arrested character may attempt to rescue their friend (the ally must provide a legible RP reason for being aware of the arrest and justify their motivation to rescue said prisoner). 

If this ally engages the arrester in combat, the arrested/kidnapped person will enter a “struggling process” with any characters that may be standing guard and be able to escape using the mechanics mentioned above.  

If rescue fails in all three threads of this arc, the arrested character will become jailed and will not be able to participate in further quests outside of the jail territory/island. Once the character is jailed, the rescuer must conquer the turf of the jail territory using turf mechanics to rescue the arrested character.

If the arrested character was imprisoned in Impel Down, the rescuer must instead complete a +4 difficulty arc to rescue the prisoner.

<span data-qltext="Sea Prism Stone" id="rdql_sea-prism">[size=16][b]EFFECTS OF SEA PRISM STONE (Kairoseki)[/b][/size]</span>

[hr]

As long as a Devil Fruit user is in direct contact with an equipment/object made of sea stone, they will suffer from a -50% reflex and -50% attack debuff and will not be able to use any abilities involving their devil fruit. As long as this devil fruit user isn’t handcuffed with sea stone, they can attempt to fight their way out of the sea stone’s grasp once per post. (An opponent can only be handcuffed with sea stone after being knocked out.)

To utilize your equipment’s sea stone debuffs, you [i]must[/i] create this effect using an equipment MT. See the [url=https://www.revivaldawn.com/t15-the-shop-of-dreams#16]Shop of Dreams[/url] for details on this.

To attempt escape from sea stone contact, you must first calculate your new DMG% against the sea stone user. You must then roll an RX check. (This RX check is rolled in Dice Roll No.1 after all of the other RX checks needed for your character in your post have been accounted for.)

This RX check die roll value must then be compared in the RX% - Die roll chart, except instead of comparing your RX%, you will be comparing your DMG%. If you roll a value equivalent to what is required for a successful MT, you will be able to escape from the effects of the Sea Stone, putting the opponent’s sea stone debuff technique into cooldown immediately.

</div></div><div class="adminPostContainer"><div class="adminPostText"><div class="adminPostSubtitle" data-qltext="Haki Basics" id="rdql_haki">Haki</div>

[hr]

Haki plays a major role in the combat of One Piece after the timeskip, and that has been maintained here. The major determining stat for Haki is Willpower. The amount of willpower you have will determine your ability to use Haki.

There are three kinds of haki, as in the manga and anime:
[b]Haoshoku:[/b] The ability to intimidate living (and even non-living) beings, overpowering their minds with a simple glare.
[b]Busoshoku:[/b] The ability to enhance one's attacks or defense through creating an "armor-like" layer over you. This effect can also be applied to both melee and ranged weapons. This haki also grants you the ability to touch the otherwise intangible logia devil-fruit users, making them solid to your attacks.
[b]Kenbunshoku:[/b] The ability to detect someone's presence, and even enhance one's reflexes by predicting the next move of the opponent.

Each kind of haki has a total of [b]10 levels[/b]. Starting from 0, counting up to 9.
The level of haki determines how many posts the stat bonuses of haki can be maintained for in an RP.
Level 0 represents the complete inability to use a particular type of haki.
The level of haki increases at every 50 increments of willpower. Here are the willpower requirements for leveling up your haki:
[b]Level 0:[/b] Less than 100 willpower
[b]Level 1:[/b] 100
[b]Level 2:[/b] 150 
[b]Level 3:[/b] 200
[b]Level 4:[/b] 250
[b]Level 5:[/b] 300
[b]Level 6:[/b] 350
[b]Level 7:[/b] 400
[b]Level 8:[/b] 450
[b]Level 9:[/b] 500


Each haki has active and passive bonuses. The active bonuses have limited durations and cooldowns as follows:
[b]DURATION[/b]
[b]Levels 1-3:[/b] 2 turns
[b]Levels 4-5:[/b] 3 turns
[b]Levels 6-8:[/b] 4 turns
[b]Level 9:[/b] 5 turns

[b]COOLDOWN[/b]
[b]Levels 1-9:[/b] 4 turns

The passive bonuses can be maintained at the user’s discretion.

[size=14][b]BUSOSHOKU (Color of Arms)[/b][/size]
[b]Active Bonus (Level 1):[/b] Ability to hit logia users or paramecia users immune to a particular type of attack. Bonus to either attack or defense equivalent to 10% of your base WP. This can be split up between ATK and DEF upon activation. 
[b]Active Bonus (Level 6):[/b] Bonus to attack or defense equivalent to 15% of your base WP. This can be split up between ATK and DEF upon activation.
[b]Active Bonus (Level 9):[/b] Bonus to attack or defense equivalent to 20% of your base WP. This can be split up between ATK and DEF upon activation.
[b]Passive Bonus (Level 4):[/b] Ability to hit logia users. (Or paramecia users immune to a particular type of attack).
The bonus distribution to attack or defense or both can only be selected upon activation, and cannot be switched while the ability is already active. 

[size=14][b]KENBUNSHOKU (Color of Observation)[/b][/size]
[b]Active Bonuses:[/b] Bonus to RX equivalent to 10% of your base WP. Ability to mask one's own presence. (While kenbunshoku haki is active, you may mask your presence from anyone that doesn't have WP more than 150% your own.)
[b]Passive Bonus (Level 2):[/b] Ability to passively detect a presence within 50m.
[b]Passive Bonus (Level 4):[/b] Ability to passively detect a presence within 200m. 
[b]Passive Bonus (Level 5):[/b] Ability to passively detect a presence within 500m.
[b]Passive Bonus (Level 9):[/b] Ability to passively detect a presence within 1km.



[size=14][b]HAOSHOKU (Color of the Supreme King)[/b][/size]
[b]Active Bonus (Level 1):[/b] Anyone within a 100m radius with willpower less than 25% of the user will be knocked out. Anyone with WP less than 50% of the user will suffer a 10% RX penalty for the duration. (Even allies will be affected.)
[b]Active Bonus (Level 4):[/b] Anyone within a 250m radius with willpower less than 25% of the user will be knocked out. Anyone with WP less than 50% of the user will suffer a 10% RX penalty for the duration. (Only selected groups or individuals will be affected.)
[b]Active Bonus (Level 6):[/b] Anyone within a 500m radius with willpower less than 25% of the user will be knocked out. Anyone with WP less than 75% of the user will suffer a 10% RX penalty for the duration. (Only selected groups or individuals will be affected.)
[b]Active Bonus (Level 9):[/b] Anyone within a 1km radius with willpower less than 35% of the user will be knocked out. Anyone with WP less than 90% of the user will suffer a 10% RX penalty for the duration. (Only selected groups or individuals will be affected.) This ability also deals bonus UT damage to objects and opponents within the user's surroundings (250m radius) every post, if the user chooses. The DMG% of this UT is calculated using WP/DEF.
[b]Passive Bonus (Level 9):[/b] Passively knock out any select groups or individuals within 100m with willpower less than 10% of the user. This passive can also do cosmetic damage to objects within the user's surroundings (25m radius), if the user chooses.

[b]Note:[/b] Unlike Busoshoku and Kenbunshoku, the only way to obtain Haoshoku Haki is by rolling it in the starting bonuses, or achieving it through an event. Otherwise, your Haoshoku will remain 0 regardless of your willpower.
[b]Note:[/b] Using Haoshoku successfully will knock out player characters, crew companions, quest bosses, and important NPCs for 2 turns, while non-important characters can be knocked out for as long as the player chooses.

<div data-qltext="Haki Specializations" id="rdql_haki-specialize">[size=16][b]HAKI SPECIALIZATIONS[/b][/size]</div>

[hr]

Once you have reached [u]level 6 Haki[/u], you can choose to specialize in Busoshoku, Kenbunshoku, or Haoshoku (or all three if you complete a certain challenge). The benefits for specializing in a type of haki are listed below.

[b]Busoshoku:[/b] An additional 10% of your base WP can be applied to ATK and/or DEF when Busoshoku is activated (e.g. Level 6 Busoshoku will give stat boosts equivalent to 25% of your willpower instead of 15%). 
RP-wise, you may reflect your Busoshoku specialization as a stronger form of the original (e.g. the type that Rayleigh and Luffy use to remove the exploding slave collars).
[b]Kenbunshoku:[/b] An additional 10% of your base WP can be applied to RX when Kenbunshoku is activated (e.g. Kenbunshoku will give stat boosts equivalent to 20% of your willpower instead of 10%). 
RP-wise, you may reflect your Kenbunshoku specialization as a stronger form of the original (e.g. Future sight of Katakuri or the antagonists of Skypiea.)
[b]Haoshoku:[/b] The WP requirement threshold for the users who are affected by your Haoshoku is increased in your favour by 10% (e.g. With Level 6 Haoshoku you can knock out anyone with WP less than 35% of your own, and inflict RX penalties to anyone with WP 85% of your own). 
RP-wise, you may reflect your Haoshoku specialization as a stronger form of the original (e.g. Shanks' Haoshoku compared to Luffy’s at Fishman Island.)

[b]CHALLENGES[/b]
If you defeat a boss of a certain difficulty, you can unlock additional haki specializations.
[b]+2 or higher:[/b] Unlock a haki specialization at Level 5 Haki instead of Level 6 (only applies if you haven’t already reached level 6 Haki yet).
[b]+3 or higher:[/b] Unlock a second specialization at Level 7 Haki.
[b]+4:[/b] Unlock a third specialization at Level 9 Haki.
[b]Note:[/b] You must have dealt the highest damage to these bosses for them to count as your kills.

</div></div><div class="adminPostContainer"><div class="adminPostText"><div class="adminPostSubtitle" data-qltext="Ship Combat" id="rdql_ship-combat">Ship Combat</div>

[hr]

The ship combat is fairly simplistic, in that it follows a similar stat system to characters.
Ships have 3 different stats.

[b]Hull:[/b] Represents the defensive capabilities of the ship. (Equivalent to the Defense Character stat)
[b]Sails:[/b] Represents the reflexive capabilities of the ship. (Equivalent to the Reflex Character stat)
[b]Cannons:[/b] Represents the offensive capabilities of the ship. (Equivalent to the Attack Character stat)

The ship stat comparisons during combat work the same way as with characters. However, all ships' HP is 250, and once it runs out, the ship is "destroyed" or "incapacitated".

Ships can use one named technique per post. However, these techniques must alternate between MTs and LTs. These techniques can be made up on the spot, but they cannot apply stat buffs/debuffs or heal HP. Ships can also use one UT against each opponent every post. For any support techniques, please avoid Deus Ex Machina.
